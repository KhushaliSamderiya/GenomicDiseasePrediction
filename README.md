# Genomic Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of specific diseases based on genomic data. Using machine learning and bioinformatics techniques, we analyze genetic variations to identify patterns associated with diseases. This approach aims to contribute to personalized medicine by enabling more accurate disease risk assessment and facilitating early interventions.

### Objectives
- To develop and validate machine learning models that can predict disease risk from genomic data.
- To identify genetic markers strongly associated with specific diseases.
- To provide a framework for integrating genomic data into disease risk assessment processes.

### Technologies Used
- Python for data processing and machine learning.
- Libraries: pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning models, keras for deep learning models.
- Bioinformatics tools for genomic data processing (e.g., BioPython, PLINK).
