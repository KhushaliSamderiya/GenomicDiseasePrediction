# Genomic Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of specific diseases based on genomic data. Using machine learning and bioinformatics techniques, we analyze genetic variations to identify patterns associated with diseases. This approach aims to contribute to personalized medicine by enabling more accurate disease risk assessment and facilitating early interventions.

### Objectives
- To develop and validate machine learning models that can predict disease risk from genomic data.
- To identify genetic markers strongly associated with specific diseases.
- To provide a framework for integrating genomic data into disease risk assessment processes.

### Technologies Used
- Python for data processing and machine learning.
- Libraries: pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning models, keras for deep learning models.
- Bioinformatics tools for genomic data processing (e.g., BioPython, PLINK).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- BioPython
- Jupyter Notebook (for exploring notebooks)

### Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up your local environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genomic-disease-prediction.git
cd genomic-disease-prediction
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
The `main.py` script serves as the entry point for running the various components of this project, including data preprocessing, model training, and predictions. Use the following commands to interact with the project from the command line:

### Preprocessing Genomic Data
To preprocess your genomic data, run:
```bash
python main.py --preprocess --data path/to/your/genomic_data.csv
```

### Training the Disease Prediction Model
To train the disease prediction model with your preprocessed data, use:
```bash
python main.py --train --data path/to/your/preprocessed_data.csv
```

### Making Predictions
Once the model is trained, you can make predictions on new genomic data:
```bash
python main.py --predict --data path/to/your/new_genomic_data.csv --model path/to/your/trained_model.h5
```

For more detailed information on the command-line arguments and options, refer to the documentation provided in the `main.py` script.
