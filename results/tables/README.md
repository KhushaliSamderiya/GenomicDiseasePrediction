# Tables Directory

## Overview
This directory contains tabular data generated from analyses. Tables often summarize model performance metrics, results from statistical tests, or any data that is best represented in a structured form.

## Contents
- **Performance Metrics:** Summaries of key model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, often broken down by class or other relevant categorizations.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Results from hyperparameter tuning exercises, detailing the parameter combinations explored and their respective performances.
- **Feature Importance Scores:** Tables listing features along with their importance scores as determined by the model, useful for understanding which features drive predictions.
- **Statistical Analysis Results:** Results from statistical analyses relevant to the bioinformatics study, such as differential gene expression analysis or enrichment analysis.

## Naming Convention
Table files are named according to the following scheme:
`<content_description>_<model_type>_<date>.<extension>`
For example, `performance_metrics_gradient_boosting_20230409.csv`.

## Note
Ensure data privacy and confidentiality are maintained, especially when dealing with sensitive information. Anonymize or de-identify data where necessary.
