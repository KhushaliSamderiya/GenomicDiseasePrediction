# Figures Directory

## Overview
This directory contains all the visual outputs generated during the analysis. These include plots, charts, and other graphical representations that help in understanding the data, the model's performance, and key insights derived from the study.

## Contents
- **Learning Curves:** Plots showing the model's training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs. Useful for diagnosing model training dynamics.
- **ROC Curves:** Receiver Operating Characteristic curves for evaluating classifier output quality.
- **Confusion Matrices:** Detailed breakdown of the model's predictions across different classes.
- **Feature Importance:** Visual representations of feature contributions to the model's predictions, particularly relevant for models like Random Forests.
- **Gene Expression Heatmaps:** Heatmaps showing gene expression levels across different conditions or sample types.
- **Dimensionality Reduction Plots:** PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP plots used to visualize high-dimensional data in a more interpretable form.

## Naming Convention
Files are named according to the following scheme:
`<analysis_type>_<model_type>_<date>.<extension>`
For example, `roc_curve_random_forest_20230409.png`.

## Note
Please ensure that any confidential or sensitive data is appropriately anonymized before generating public figures.
